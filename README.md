# The Repository

- This repository is for a web application to generate a randomized password using various parameters and setting certain criteria. 

# User Story

- A user will select parameters using the prompts provided on the webpage. One will first set the length of the password (minimum 8 characters and maximum 128 characters), then confirm having lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols added to their password. After clicking the generate button a randomized password should appear in the textbox above!

# Overall Conclusion

I will be turning in this assignment incomplete, as I really struggled with the javascript logic and writing all the syntax. Talked with a TA about how I got ahead of myself on this one and made my code more complicated than it needed to be. 

I ran out of time my so README won't have pictures yet and the primary functions of this application will still need work! This started to make more sense after going over it in office hours, but it's still not finished. I will continue to work on this project until I get everything working!
